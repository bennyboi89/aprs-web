<h1 id="polaric-webapp">Polaric webapp</h1>
<p>The &quot;Polaric Server&quot; is mainly a web based service to present APRS tracking information on maps and where the information is updated in real-time. It is originally targeted for use by radio amateurs in voluntary search and rescue service in Norway. It consists of a web application and a server 
program (APRS daemon). </p>
<p>The web application lets the user browse maps. It can present live APRS infomation (from the aprsd backend) on top of the map. Users can update information, add objects, etc.. The application supports use of the Mapcache Apache module that can render and/or cache maps. Web clients can also be set up to use external map sources directly. </p>

<h2 id="building-from-source">Building from source</h2>
<p>Build from the source is done by a plain old makefile. Yes I know :)
Setup for generating Debian packages is included. You may use the &#39;debuild&#39; 
command.</p>
<p>You will need the Closure Compiler from Google to compress the javascript 
code. See compile-js.sh. </p>
